                                <p>Back in 2016, many became invested in the domestic abuse charges against Johnny Depp.
                                    According to Amber Heard�s testimonies of the incident, her ex-husband had hit her
                                    (with photos to support this) and at one point, she took a video of him flinging a
                                    wine glass in a fit of rage. She said that this would happen when Johnny would lose
                                    his temper and would lash out on her, verbally and physically.</p>

                                <p> A WOMAN being hit and subjugated to violence seems to have taken a worrying trend of
                                    new �normalcy� in recent times. We�ve read too many news reports, heard too many
                                    commentaries and what�s even more worrying � in this nation � we�ve heard too many
                                    excuses trying to explain away the problem.</p>

                                <p>AVANNAH, Ga. � Latrelle Huff says her twins were conceived by rape.

                                    Now she blames domestic violence for her children's health problems.

                                    The Georgia woman says she had been in an abusive, on-and-off relationship for six
                                    years when she became pregnant. While pregnant, she says, the conflict continued.
                                    Huff spent 25 of 37 weeks on bed rest, she says, due in part to rectal bleeding her
                                    doctors said was caused by stress. </p>
